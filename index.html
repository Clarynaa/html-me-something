                Clary first began programming around 2002, back in the days of Myspace.&diams;<br>
                Profile editing was all the rage back then, and she delved a little into the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that made up a page.

                Years later, sometime in the early 2010's Clary and her partner decided that they had a dream they wanted to bring to life.<br>
                That dream was a game.  Upon doing research they decided upon Hero Engine.&spades;<br>
                It was an ambitious project that even with paid professionals helping dive into the API for Hero Engine there was almost no progress.<br>

            <p class="story">
                A short hiatus and the two of them decided to continue pursuing their dream in a different game engine, Unity.&hearts;<br>
                Going through programming classes at the same time as working on the project, Clary had a bit more of a handle on things this time<br>
                She managed to get a few basics working, but then hit a wall, and gave up.<br><br>
                A few months later, Clary finished her programming course and dove back into Unity.<br>
                With determination she managed to make a few "games" by following tutorials.  She felt ready for a real game.<br>
                Clary managed to create a working prototype of a single round of all of the mechanics that would be present in the game.<br>
                Something in her AI code broke most of her code.  Nothing worked right anymore.  She was completely demoralized and gave up again.

                After a few more years Clary wanted to pursue her game again.  This time she applied to some scholarships while self-teaching.<br>
                Upon receiving a scholarship from Google and Udacity to learn android programming she got the drive to code for a living.<br>
                Clary abandoned the idea of working on her game until she could program better, but instead threw herself head first into the scholarship.<br>
                After the first unit of the android scholarship finished she had received word that she was accepted to LaunchCode as well.<br>
                Android wasn't Clary's thing, and she didn't have time to work on both, so she accepted the LaunchCode scholarship and left Android behind.<br>
                Her journey rapidly grew in pace, and she has become a mentor as well as receiving praise from many professionals and talent acquisition teams.<br>
                She is currently well on her way towards the new dream of being a professional software developer.
